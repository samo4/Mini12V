# Small, mostly SMD 12V switch mode power supply
It's just a PCB implementation of manufacturer's [ON Semiconductor](http://www.onsemi.com/) recommendations.

### Why
I wanted to make my first SMPS, and chose a simple design to see how it behaves. Key design consideration was to find of-the-shelf magnetics.. and [Coilcraft](http://www.coilcraft.com/) came to the rescue.

## Specifications
230V input
12V / 1.25A output

### Contributing
Boards are made using a free (but not opensource) DesignSpark PCB. 

### Status

Waiting for [Itead](https://www.itead.cc/) to produce my PCBs..
